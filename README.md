# Tank Sim Project
**By: Rashad**  
This is a project I'm working on to refamiliarize myself with C++ Development.  
Doxygen Commenting, Unit testing, and a custom codestyle are the main skills I'll be focusing on - as well as utilizing ROS for robot control.  

Only building for windows atm, anything else is untested 


## Outline
  **Project Goals**  
  - **C++ Text based simulation** (Stage 1)
  - **ROS integration** (Stage 2)
  - **Unreal Engine implementation** (Stage 3)
  - **Environment Mapping Utilizing Kinect V2** (Stage 4)  
  
**Reach Goals:**
- Vulkan rendering/ basic game engine instead of UE5 Implementation
- Projection mapping?
